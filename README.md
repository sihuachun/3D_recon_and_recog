# 3D_recon_and_recog
### Project description:
Use Siamese neural network to realize the authentication of positive and negative image sample pairs.
### Steps:
1.Visualize 3D image data and construct 2D and 3D positive and negative sample pair data sets;
   
2.Construct a twin neural network framework based on deep separable convolutional network, fully connected layer and contrast loss function;
   
3.Baidu AI Studio platform trains the model network and debugs and optimizes the neural network structure and neural network parameters;
   
4.Generate a network model and output the visualized results of positive and negative samples for authentication;
